# Java-HikariCP

I have built a small connection framework using HikariCP that allows for the addition of multiple datasources from the same DBMS or different DBMSs. 
It also supports separate instances for read and write connections.

However, on the Parameters class, you might want to replace the values with env variables. 

Enjoy coding!
